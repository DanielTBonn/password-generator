- What problem does it solve?

To ensure realibly complicated passwords could be generated for securing information, I created a password generating script that runs in the browser. You may choose from a variety of options
allowing you to create a password that is at least 8 characters to as much as 128 characters in length, as well as including uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters. Having the option of choosing a
randomly generated password makes it difficult to steal information and try to access personal data. During this project I learned some of the nuances of type conversion in JavaScript, how to call the window object
to prompt for user input, and how to generate random numbers using the built-in Math object.
